            <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am a 24-year-old nurse who is looking to expand her skillset. In the past, I was insecure about my lack of knowledge surrounding technology but I have gained confidence through taking this course. I'm currently learning how to play the guitar and I have picked up crocheting as well. When I'm not indulging in my hobbies, I love to rewatch shows such as Gilmore Girls and How I Met Your Mother.</p>
